## Day 8 - React Native

### Before we meet

- [ ] Have a smartphone with a camera.

  - iOS: [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779)

### Notes

We recommend your smartphone be connected to the same WiFi network as your computer, so that the app can be loaded from your computer to the device. If that is not possible, you'll have to start the development server in tunnel mode. To do that, change the following line of the `package.json` file, including the `--tunnel` option:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "expo start --tunnel",
```
